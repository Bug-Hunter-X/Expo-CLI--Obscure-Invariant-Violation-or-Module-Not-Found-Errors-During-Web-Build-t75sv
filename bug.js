This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `react-native-web` functionality and have a dependency that's not compatible with the web platform.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact issue, leading to confusion.  For example, you might see a generic error like `Invariant Violation` or a module not found error during the web build process, but the root cause is an incompatible native module.
