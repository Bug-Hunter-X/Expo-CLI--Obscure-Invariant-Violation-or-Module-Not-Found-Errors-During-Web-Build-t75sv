The solution involves carefully examining your `package.json` dependencies.  Look for modules that rely heavily on native platform APIs, such as those related to Bluetooth, camera access, or complex UI components. These modules often lack web support. Here's how to approach this:

1. **Identify the culprit:**  The error message (though vague) might offer clues. Check the stack trace to see which modules are involved during the problematic build step.
2. **Check for web-compatible alternatives:**  Search for web-compatible versions of your native modules.  Many libraries provide separate packages for web (`react-native-web`-compatible versions).
3. **Conditional imports:** Use conditional logic to import different versions based on the environment. You can detect this using `Platform.OS` from React Native.

```javascript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

let MyComponent;
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  MyComponent = require('./MyWebComponent'); // Web-compatible component
} else {
  MyComponent = require('./MyNativeComponent'); // Native component
}
```

4. **Eject from Expo (last resort):** If you've exhausted other options, consider ejecting from Expo. This gives you full control over the build process but might be a more involved solution.
